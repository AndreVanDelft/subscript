Subscript is an extension to the Scala programming language that is based on the Algebra of Communicating Processes (ACP). It adds "scripts" as a new refinement construct, that contain a kind of algebraic expressions.

Threading and event-handling are badly supported by mainstream programming languages: the flow of control is often unclear, and programmers lose overview. The result is frozen applications and stressed users.

Subscript aims to improve this situation. It supports parallelism and non-deterministic choice as much as sequential composition. Event-handling code is easily mixed with normal code. You can easily express

  * the "grammars" of Graphical User Interfaces
  * concurrency, e.g., in the benchmark program Sieve of Eratosthenes
  * language grammars, which are useful when parsing texts
  * discrete event simulations

For a first impression, consider a simple lookup application:

In Java this is still quite hard to program, due to the threading aspects. In SubScript you can program this easily and concisely:
```
  searchSequence    = searchCommand    showSearchingText 
                      searchInDatabase showSearchResults

  searchCommand     = searchButton
  showSearchingText = @gui: {outputTA.text = "Searching: "+searchTF.text}
  showSearchResults = @gui: {outputTA.text = "Found: 3 items"}
  searchInDatabase  = {* Thread.sleep 3000 *} // simulate a time consuming action
```

The [Wiki](http://code.google.com/p/subscript/wiki/Contents) provides a more detailed explanation and some other examples. It also highlights the theoretical background, and describes the language features and the implementation model.

Note that these Wiki pages are meant to become a explanation and reference for an initial implementation and language definition; the aim of these pages is not to give programmers and researchers a clear and well dosed introduction and specification; these will only arrive after an implementation is made available.

Subscript succeeds the language [Scriptic](http://code.google.com/p/scriptic), which is freely available on Google Code. Subscript applies some lessons learnt from Scriptic usage in 2010:

  * simplified syntax for old functionality
  * simplified semantics for process communication
  * simplified support for 'forcing' parameters
  * removed language features for discrete event simulations
  * allow for plug-in support for discrete event simulations, parallel execution etc
  * syntactic sugar for very concise specifications
  * support for communication over networks and pipes
  * support for more flavours of parallelism and suspension operators
  * unambiguous language definition

The SubScript software is still being developed. There is a partial implementation as a small Scala library, so without the typical syntax but as a Scala DSL; a rudimentary graphical debugger is also available. To experiment with this SubScript implementation, you could use Eclipse with the Scala and Mercurial plugins.

To get a feeling for programming with the SubScript syntax, you could try out the predecessor language Scriptic. An installation guide and student assignments are available at [the Scriptic Wiki](http://code.google.com/p/scriptic/w/list).

I am looking for feedback and support. Feel free to contact me at andre.vandelft at gmail.
Students computer science and software engineering are welcome to do a [project](http://code.google.com/p/subscript/wiki/StudentProjects).
